#This will be the file where I implement the calculation methods. 

#Method 1: do the haversine formula with the inputs of: a techer's coordinates, and a centroid candidate location's coordinates

#Method 2: Calculate the quality of the centroid by averageing/summing all the distances (not sure yet whether sum or average is better)

#Method 3: take a list with all the possible centroid coordinate candidates, and append to each coordinate the "quality" of the centroid
